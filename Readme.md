### Building / Packaging
The best option for packaging the `text` files is to create a Dierectory inside `Content` (e.g. `Data`) and put all these kind of files there. Then, with `Project Settings --> Project --> Packaging --> Additional Non-Asset Directories to Package` add the `Data` direcotry to be cooked / packaged with the build.
